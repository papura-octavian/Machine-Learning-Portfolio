# Machine Learning Projects & Experiments

This repository contains a growing collection of machine learning notebooks built for learning, experimentation, and portfolio development.

Projects cover different datasets and problem types, with a focus on:
- clean and consistent ML workflows
- leakage-safe preprocessing pipelines
- simple, interpretable baseline models
- correct evaluation metrics

The goal is understanding and progression, not production-ready systems.

## Included Projects

- **Customer Churn Prediction**  
  Binary classification using tabular data, with emphasis on recall and business interpretation.

- **Student Performance Prediction**  
  Classification / regression on educational data, focusing on feature preprocessing and model interpretability.

## Common Workflow

All notebooks generally follow the same structure:
1. Data exploration and cleaning  
2. Train / test split  
3. Preprocessing with pipelines  
4. Model training  
5. Evaluation and interpretation  

This makes the repository easy to extend with new datasets and tasks.
